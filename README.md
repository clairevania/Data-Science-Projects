## [Project 1: Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/clairevania/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/stroke.ipynb)
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.


## Project 2: Breast Cancer Detection
Breast cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer, with 7.8 million women surviving with the disease. Approximately 0.5-1% of breast cancers occur in men.

The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) is from UCI ML Repository. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
